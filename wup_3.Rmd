```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```

   The front and the middle seat might look the same but the middle seats have more outliers. The back box is the median and is it also higher than the front and middle seat.
  


## Numerical Summarys 

## Inferential Tests
```{r}
favstats(alcohol~Seat,data=ucdavis1)
```



## Conclusions
